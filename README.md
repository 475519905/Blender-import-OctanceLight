Blender Section:
Installing scripts in Blender is relatively simple, mainly divided into two situations: directly running Python scripts and installing plugins (Addon).
Open Blender. Select "Scripting" from the menu. Create a new script by clicking on "New" in the upper left corner, or click "Open" to load an existing script file. Paste or write your Python code in the script editor. Click the "Run Script" button to execute the script. Install plugin (Addon):
Download the Blender plugin you want to install, usually a. py file. Open Blender, go to Edit>Preferences>Add ons. Click the "Install" button and select your plugin file.
Cinema 4D Section:
Find your Cinema 4D installation directory. In this directory, search for a folder named "library/scripts". Copy your Python script files to this directory. Restart Cinema 4D or refresh in the script menu, your script should now be visible. Plug in installation:
Download the plugin you want to install, usually a. zip or. c4dplugin file. Find the plugin directory for Cinema 4D, usually located in the "plugins" folder under the installation directory. Extract or copy the downloaded plugin to this directory. Restart Cinema 4D, the plugin should be automatically loaded. Please note that it is crucial to ensure that the downloaded scripts or plugins are compatible with your Blender or Cinema 4D version. Before installing any scripts or plugins, it is best to back up your settings and important projects. For the installation of specific plugins, you should also refer to the official installation guide of the plugin, as some plugins may have special installation steps.
